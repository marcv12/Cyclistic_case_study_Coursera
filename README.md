# Google Data Analytics' Capstone project: Cyclistic case study

I am a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share company. Its success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.  
Follow along with this project to get an in-depth analysis of the Google Data Analytics' Capstone project and enjoy some humor along the way!  
The main task is to convert casual riders into members. Sounds easy? We'll see! Follow me along this journey to discover some intriguing insights and strengthen your knowledge in data analysis.  
  

In this project, I followed the process taught by Google in the intensive 8-course specialization, mainly: 
- Ask 
- Prepare 
- Process
- Analyze
- Share 
- Act
  
  
Here, I provide the final report for my project, for the ones who are just interested in the final outcome:  [Report](https://ccyzzvc0pnsf60ehtkzvuw.on.drv.tw/Cyclistic_report.html)
